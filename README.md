# SPOJ Solutions

These are my solutions to SPOJ (http://www.spoj.pl/) problems. Most of the solutions are in ruby.

If you are participating in SPOJ, please don't use these as your own submissions. Also only look at
the solution of a problem if you have already successfully submitted for the problem.

## Disclaimer

These solutions are probably not optimal and I don't guarantee they will pass in SPOJ unmodified.
